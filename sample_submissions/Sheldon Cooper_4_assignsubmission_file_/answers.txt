Question 1: Who is your favorite Turing award winner?

Answer:

Barbara Liskov. When I read historical CS papers, I often get this magical feeling where I
appreciate how ideas I take for granted had to be invented by someone. No where was this
feeling more apparent than when reading through Liskov's seminal paper "Data Abstraction and
Hierarchy." It's like reading about English from the person who invented English grammar (if
English grammar had any semblance of the elegance of a well-designed object-oriented design
pattern). Was this eloquent enough? Did I get all of the points?

Question 2: What is your favorite code annotation tool?

Answer:

GitHub is pretty cool...actually I'm going to go with codePost here. Why? It's pretty cool that
you can deduct points directly from comments, comments can linked to rubric items, dark mode...
I'm just a student, but I can imagine these features makes life much easier for my instructors.
Also it's neat how I can leave feedback on feedback. Sometimes a rubric comment just doesn't make
sense, ya know?
